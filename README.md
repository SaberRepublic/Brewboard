Brewboard is a carrier board for an Arduino Nano, DFPlayer and GY-521 accelerometer. It is designed to make it easy and cheap to build a homebrew soundboard for your saber or other custom props. While it's not as small as other choices on the market it is cheap fully opensource and full-featured. You can use different firmware solutions or roll your own.

 - Connects Arduino Nano, DFPlayer, and GY-521
 - Supports Neo-Pixel and RGB/RGBW Star LEDs and string blades* (with added MOSFETs and resitors)
 - Uses 0805 resitors and sot23 MOSFETs to keep it's footprint small.
